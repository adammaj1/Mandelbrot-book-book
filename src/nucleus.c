Computing c just by iterating fc  could take many 1000s of iterations, especially when multiplier Î»  is close to 1 = point is near boundary of componennt

You may need very small epsilon and very large n, otherwise for example c = -3/4+10^{-10}  will probably give an incorrect period of 2  instead of the correct period of 1
, which error will compound to an incorrect interior distance estimate (for example distance 3.8e-8 with your method (epsilon 1e-12, n 79,573,343
) instead of 2e-10 with my method).
